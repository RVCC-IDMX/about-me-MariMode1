        <h2>Background of Country Georgia</h2>

        <div>
            <p>In the verdant embrace of the Caucasus, Georgia dances between 
                ancient mountains and vibrant valleys, where the whispers of history 
                intertwine with the melodies of folk songs. The flavors of khachapuri 
                swirl through the air, as traditions unfold beneath the watchful gaze 
                of the sun-drenched vineyards, each grape a silent witness to the tales
                 of resilience and creativity. With every corner, a tapestry of cultures 
                 weaves its way into the soul of this land, painting a portrait of both 
                 unity and diversity, much like the intricate patterns of a traditional 
                 Georgian carpet.</p> <p>As the rivers flow like the stories of the past,
                Tbilisi emerges as a kaleidoscope of architecture, where the old an new collide 
                in a harmonious cacophony. The Sulphur baths steam with the secrets of centuries, 
                inviting travelers to soak in the warmth of hospitality and tradition. From the 
                rustic charm of the cobbled streets to the lively squares filled with laughter, 
                Georgia’s capital embodies a spirit that transcends time, as if each stone were 
                infused with the heartbeat of its people, echoing the rhythms of life.</p> 
                <p>In the realm of folklore, the tales of the heroes of ancient epics leap 
                from the pages, their valor resonating like the strum of a lute in the 
                twilight. Mountains loom like guardians, sheltering secrets of the past 
                 while offering breathtaking vistas that inspire both poets and wanderers alike.
                 The paradox of modernity and tradition dances in festivals that celebrate the 
                 harvest, the seasons, and the very essence of being, where laughter mingles 
                with the clinking of glasses filled with the finest wines, each sip a tribute to
                 the land’s rich heritage.</p> <p>On the horizon, the shadow of the Great Caucasus 
                stands tall, a sentinel of nature’s artistry, inviting adventurers to explore its 
                trails. The flora and fauna tell a story of biodiversity, each species a brushstroke 
                on the canvas of existence, as the air is thick with the scent of wildflowers and pine. 
                As the sun sets, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, the rhythm of life in Georgia 
                continues, a testament to the unyielding spirit of a people who cherish their roots while 
                reaching for the stars.</p> <p>Ultimately, the essence of Georgia lies not just in its 
                landscapes or traditions but in the warmth of its people, who greet strangers with open arms 
                and a song in their hearts. Each smile is a reminder that within the chaos of life, there 
                exists a harmony that binds us all together, transcending borders and languages. As the stories
                unfold like petals of a blooming flower, Georgia remains a timeless muse, an eternal canvas painted 
                with the colors of joy, sorrow, and the undeniable magic of existence.</p>
